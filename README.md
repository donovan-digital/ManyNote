# ManyNote
A scientific note taking app

ManyNote is intended as a successor to OneNote Desktop for academic and (some) professional environments. OneNote Desktop 
is reaching end-of-life and there were many missed opportunities that kept it from reaching its full potential.

USER STORIES

Megan is an undergrad who wants to typeset beautiful math equations the way she sees some of her classmates do, but even if she had time to 
learn LaTeX she would have trouble typing it fast enough to take notes.

Frank is a graduate TA at a research school. He needs a fast way to prepare quizzes for his calculus course.

Aparna is a PhD chemistry researcher. In addition to preparing exams for the classes she teaches she needs a fast and intuitive way to 
format papers for publication.

Jill is an EE at a company that manufactures electronics components. She needs a tool that will let her quickly take meeting notes, 
draw circuits, and store and collate material from online searches and PDFs.



DEVELOPMENT

I plan to write ManyNote in Python/Cython in order to leverage Matplotlib and LaTeX compatibility.

PLANNED FEATURES (in some order)

Lightweight DOM for positioning and alignment

Rapid math input via shortcuts

Support for as many latex packages as possible

Multiple user-selectable organizational methods (tree,mind map, etc)

Easy xml templates for various journal formats
